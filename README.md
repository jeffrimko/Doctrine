Doctrine
========

Utility for quickly viewing rendered [Asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/).

To view a document, simply open the text file in the application. The text will be rendered to a local `__doctrine__.html` file; please note that this file will deleted when the application is closed or a different document is opened. If the text file is modified, it can be reloaded to display the updated document. All local relative links should function properly.

Additionally, a document can be archived in a zip file. Asset files can be included in the archive and relative links should function.

Big thanks to [Stuart Rackham](http://www.methods.co.nz/stuart.html) for developing the excellent Asciidoc format.
